## This is a golf website to see how bad I (Connor Fewin) am at the game of Golf.

The goal of this website is to get better at golf while improving my full stack developement skills via react and aws.

3 questions I want answered:
- What are my strengths and weaknesses?
- How do I play each hole (par 3s vs 4s vs 5s)? What are my real scoring opportunities?
- How do I shoot each club?

This will be updated along the way.
